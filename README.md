# 🦠 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## 📌 Project Description
This project analyzes global COVID-19 data to visualize and compare the spread and response across three countries: **Kenya**, **India**, and the **United States**. The dataset used is sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus).

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Import and clean real-world COVID-19 data
- Explore trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Compare key metrics between countries over time
- Visualize findings with meaningful charts
- Summarize insights in a narrative report

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3.x
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- Jupyter Notebook (VS Code extension or JupyterLab)

## ▶️ How to Run/View the Project
1. Clone this repository or download the notebook file.
2. Ensure `owid-covid-data.csv` is in the same directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook in VS Code or JupyterLab.
4. Run cells sequentially to view analysis and charts.

## 📊 Insights & Reflections
- The USA had the highest number of cases and deaths, followed by India.
- Kenya experienced fewer cases but had inconsistent reporting in vaccination data.
- Death rates declined over time, potentially due to improved healthcare and vaccine rollouts.
- India faced a massive spike in mid-2021, highlighting variant-driven surges.
- Vaccination rollout speed and coverage varied greatly by country.
